.Development Methods
Agile Method::
Allows for testing and feedback while developing.
Small changes more regularly.
This is focused on adaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times.

Waterfall Method:: 
Project sees little user feedback before release.
Big changes over longer time periods.
Breaks down the project into linear sequential phases that are rigidly followed.
.Phases
1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Construction
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance
* These phases are described in the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model[wikipedia article]

.Neural Networks
1. Higher Brain
2. Mid brain
3. Lower Brain

.User Interaction Problems vs Systems Model Problems
* Consider false positives regarding the rocket switch gear shift
- The lizard brain doesn't know that there is a problem.
that's the worst kind of problem
* false positives don't happen that much in software.
An issue happened with Playstation 5 sales when it was released.
* Reflect on conventions from jan11 reading notes.
- conventions tend to have some sort of que, be it visual or tactile.
- consider users' expected design conventions

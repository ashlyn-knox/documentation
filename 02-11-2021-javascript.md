* you can use evt in place of event within a function declaration if you want

* access form values with form.num1.value; by assigning that statement to a variable. num number is relative to the value that you are accessing
* event.preventDefault() will stop the form from submitting on refresh
* remember that form data is always input as strings, if you need numbers, you need to convert to numerical data. **parseInt() can be applid to the data points to turn it into an integer** Remember to do this at the source and not in the output

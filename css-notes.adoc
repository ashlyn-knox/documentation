= CSS Notes
A quick overview of some important commands.
I'm not including stuff that I"m already comfortable with.


== Attribute selectors
* Multiple classes can be used
* order of classes defined in the html element doesn't matter
* order of classes declared in css style does matter
* Id overrides class
* inline style overrides 
* Add `!IMPORTANT` to the class to override everything
** example: `color: red !important;`
Multiple Classes::
`<tag class="class1, class2">`
* Make sure to include multiple classes within the same class="" tag

=== id artributes
* especially useful for javascript
* these must be unique
* use # in the css
* **not reusable**

type attribute::
`[attr=value]`
* selector matches and styles elements within a specific attribute value

== Custom CSS Variables
These can be used elsewhere in the css file

Custom variable syntax::
`--variableName: value;`

Reference custom variables in other css rules::
`background: var(--variableName);`

Fallbacks::
`background: var(--variableName, fallbackValue)`
* It can be a good idea too use fallback values for when browsers fail to render cerntain things.
This is especially important for old browsers.
* Set fallbacks before the preferred one

== Layout

Padding::
controls space between element's content and its border
* Can be specified in one line, clockwise.
** `paddding: top right bottom left;`

Margin::
space between an element's border and surrounding elements
* use negative space to make an element grow larger
* can be specified in one line clockwise just like padding
** `margin: top right bottom left;`
== Typography

=== link external fonts

Link to HTML::
`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open Sans" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`

== Images


=== borders

* border-color
* border-width
* border-style

Rounded Corners::
`border-radius`
* can be done as a percent or with pixels.
* 50% is perfectly round

== Relative Units

em::
size based on the size of an elements font.
If used to set a font-size, it is relative to the parent's font size
